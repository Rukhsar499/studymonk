A micro-class is the perfect arena for this. Guided by a mentor, students learn to build on each other's insights, defend their positions with evidence, and sharpen their arguments against the thoughtful critiques of their peers. This is how we forge true intellectual horsepower."

By regularly articulating their ideas to a small group and learning from the perspectives of others, your child develops a deeper, more flexible understanding of the material. They don't just learn the content; they learn how to demonstrate their mastery with the clarity and confidence examiners look for."
